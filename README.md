<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/josueaosilverio/presentationKaraoke)

PowerPoint Karaoke, also known as Battledecks or Battle Decks, is an improvisational activity in which a participant must deliver a presentation based on a set of slides that they have never seen before. Its name is derived from Microsoft PowerPoint, a popular presentation software, and karaoke, an activity in which a performer sings along with a pre-recorded backing track (although there is usually no music or singing involved in PowerPoint Karaoke). The effect is intended to be comical, and PowerPoint Karaoke can be considered a form of improvisational theatre, or a type of Theatresports game.

This projecto makes the process faster and more fun by making a completely random presentation using images, numbers and words.
